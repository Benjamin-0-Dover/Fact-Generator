All facts are supplied from <a href="https://github.com/assaf/dailyhi/blob/master/facts.txt"><b>Here.</b></a><br>Very special thanks to mr-winson on gihub! He is the one that made the array of variables for me so i didnt have to copy and paste each individual fact one by one. You can click <a href="https://github.com/mr-winson">Here</a> to visit his page.Some facts may be incorrect or slightly off due to the fact that I am not able to verify each one and the <b>fact </b>that they are from 2010.<br></p>
